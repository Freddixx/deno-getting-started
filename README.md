# Deno: Getting Started

This repo was created as a showcase for [an article I wrote on Medium](https://medium.com/codex/up-and-running-with-deno-for-node-js-developers-f4c4c34e6287).

If you have never worked with Deno, I highly recommend checking out the link above.

## Running the code

There is not much to run here, but if you'd like to do it anyways, just go with:

```deno compile --unstable 2-simple-dependency.ts```

## More Context

Deno is a Node.js alternative which uses Typescript out of the box. Since it's highly compatible with all of the principles you are used to from the web, you should give it a try!
